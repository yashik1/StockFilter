/**
 * What each feature costs, and what it is allowed to cost.
 *
 * The first half of this file is ordinary paywall arithmetic: a Pro feature
 * opens for a Pro subscriber and not for anyone else, a lapsed payer falls
 * back to what an account alone buys, and the development access mode opens
 * the paid tiers without touching who has actually paid.
 *
 * The second half is the part that matters more. Backtesting, the moving
 * averages and the price alerts are built on market data licensed for
 * personal, non-commercial use, so selling them would breach the terms the
 * data arrived under — a legal constraint that is completely invisible in the
 * code that draws a chart. Those tests exist to fail loudly if a later change
 * moves one of them behind a paid plan.
