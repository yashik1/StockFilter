/**
 * What each feature costs, and what it is *allowed* to cost.
 *
 * One table, consulted by every gate in the app — pages, API routes and
 * server actions alike — so "what does this cost" is answered in exactly one
 * place. The previous version of this had a single boolean, paid or not, and
 * seven call sites asking it; the reason that worked is that there was only
 * ever one thing to sell.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PART THAT IS NOT ABOUT PRICING
 *
 * Some of this app's most attractive features cannot legally be sold, and the
 * reason is invisible in the code that implements them.
 *
 * Price history and quotes come from Twelve Data, Tiingo and Finnhub on their
 * free tiers, which licence the data for personal, non-commercial use. That
 * is a contractual limit rather than a technical one: no amount of caching,
 * proxying or attribution makes charging a subscriber for access to that data
 * permitted. It is the provider's call, not ours. So backtesting, the moving
 * averages, and any alert that watches a price are free-with-an-account
 * permanently — not as a generosity, and not as a launch promotion, but
 * because selling them would breach the terms the data arrived under.
 *
 * Everything sellable here rests on SEC EDGAR, which is public domain and
 * carries no such restriction, or on data the reader typed in themselves.
 *
 * The `kind` field below makes that distinction structural instead of a
 * comment somebody has to notice. A feature marked `personal-use-data` is
 * typed so that its `requires` can only be "anyone" or "account" — writing
 * `requires: "pro"` against one is a compile error, not a code review
 * question. That is deliberate: this constraint is exactly the kind that gets
 * quietly undone months later by someone reorganising a pricing page, and a
 * type is the only form of it that survives that.

 * What a visitor has to be to use something, in increasing order.
